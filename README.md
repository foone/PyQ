# PyQ
Python remake of HighQ for importing high quality WAVs to 3DMM

3D Movie Maker converts WAV files to lower quality when importing, so this utility (and it's predecessor HighQ) 
get around this by making a dummy .3mm file which includes the WAV at full quality, which you can then import with no quality loss.

# Usage:

1. Install a version of python 2 from python.org
2. run python PyQ.py SOUNDFILE.WAV
3. Import the new SOUNDFILE.3MM file into 3dmm.
